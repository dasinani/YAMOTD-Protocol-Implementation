TCP Client–Server Message Exchange System (Python)
• Developed a TCP-based client–server application in Python for secure message storage and retrieval.
• Implemented custom protocol commands (MSGGET, MSGSTORE, QUIT, SHUTDOWN) with authentication and error handling.
• Used socket programming to manage TCP connections and data flow between multiple clients.
• Designed test cases to validate command handling, message updates, and password-protected server shutdown.
• Strengthened knowledge of TCP/IP, Python networking, and protocol design.
